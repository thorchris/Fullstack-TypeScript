# Alternative startkode for the GraphQL-lynda tutorial

For part 1+2 I have added a supplementing TypeScript version

For the remaining parts I suggest you stick to JavaScript to keep focus on GraphQL, and also not to focus on THREE different type systems: interfaces, mongoose schemas, and GraphQL schemas

The exercises for this period will provide hints for how to use GraphQL with TypeScript, whitout any additional tools.

# Important (for part 3+4)
Remember to add a .env-file with your connection details:

`CONNECTION=xxxxxx`
